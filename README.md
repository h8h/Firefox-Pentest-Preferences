Firefox Browser Preferences for Security Researchers
=
Our goals are to:
* make a better surf experience for security researchers (pentester / penetration tester or hackers)
* stop blowing up MitM-Proxies like BurpSuite with Updates, search suggestions or "oh" - wait I search the captive portal for you.
*** 
This is an open source project. Your contributions and pull requests are welcome.

Installation
---
Create a new firefox profile and place the user.js inside this profile folder.
To figure out the profile folder or to create a new profile see:
`about:profiles`

**Check**:
* Open `about:config`. If there is no warning, the installation was successful.
* Or open a new tab, if there is nothing, the installation was successful.
* Or type google in the address bar. If the site could not be found and there is no search executed the installation was successful.

Limits
--------
* URL normalization ([RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.2.4)) can no longer be turned off. I found this thread on [StackOverflow](https://superuser.com/questions/1122056/tell-firefox-not-to-normalize-a-url), but the flag is no longer valid.. That's why path traversal attempts have to be tested with other tools.
